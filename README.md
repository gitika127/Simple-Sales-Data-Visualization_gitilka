# Simple Sales Data Visualization

## Overview
This project provides a simple way to visualize sales data using Python. Users can input sales information, including product name, units sold, and revenue, and the program generates a bar chart to display the revenue distribution among products.

## Features
- User-friendly input system for entering sales data
- Automatic storage of data in a structured format using Pandas
- Bar chart visualization using Matplotlib
- Clear tabular display of inputted sales data

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas (for data handling)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)


## Usage
1. The program prompts the user to enter the number of sales entries.
2. For each entry, the user provides:
   - Product Name
   - Units Sold
   - Revenue
3. The program processes the data and displays:
   - A tabular view of the input data
   - A bar chart representing revenue per product

## Future Enhancements
- Support for data import from CSV files
- Additional visualization types (pie charts, line graphs)
- Exporting data and visualizations to reports
